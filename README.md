# 🛠️ AI-Based Steganography Detector
This repository made for an AI-powered steganography detection system using deep learning. The project includes **training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on stego images and detecting hidden information inside digital images.  This project can be a great starting component of a Security Operations Center (SOC), Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR), or Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) system, by giving it an automated layer of anti-malware analysis in context of a security framework.


## 📌 **Dataset**
We used the **Stego Images Dataset** from **Kaggle**:

🔗 [Stego Images Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcozuppelli/stegoimagesdataset)

The dataset consists of **clean** and **stego** images, which must be correctly organized into separate folders before training.
If the dataset is not structured properly, use the `organize_data.py` script to arrange the files.


## **Installation**
First, clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Steganography-Detection.git`

`cd Steganography-Detection`


Then, install all required dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## **Training the Model**
To train the model, use the train.py script:

`python train.py`

The trained model will be saved as:

`/PATH/TO/steganography_detector.h5`

The training process will:
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Use binary classification (clean vs. stego images)
- Save only the best performing model
- Delete unnecessary files to save storage

## **Using the Detection Script**
Once the model is trained, run the detect.py script:

`python detect.py`

Input: Enter the image path when prompted.
Output: The script will classify the image as either:
🛑 Steganography Detected
✅ Clean Image


## **Example usage:**

Enter image path: `C:/Users/User/Documents/test_image.png`

🔍 Raw Model Output: 0.34

✅ Clean Image

## **File Structure:**

│── /dataset     

## **Requirements:**

Ensure that Python 3.10+ is installed. Use the following command to install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
